## Crop Wild Relative on US Forest Service lands

*Updated* : 2025-02-7

Significant overhall to the workflow with the specific aims of 

1. Utilize the USFS datasets to organize information 
  - layer 1 : Admin layer (112 unique areas)
  - level 2 : PADUS Fee Areas  (276)
  - level 3a : Wilderness Areas (451)
  - level 3b : Botnaical Areas (46)

2. Summarize the total number of species predicted and observed at these areas 
  - predicted : at least a single cell of a habitat suitability model in within the area boundary for a species 
  - observed : at least a single point observation for a specific is found within the area boundary 
  
  
## Maps 

There are quite a few way to showcase these relationship currently were showing four. 
 
 - total taxon (predicted and observed)
 - total taxon observed
 - total taxon predicted 
 - density of observed taxon 

### [Total taxon predicted and observed](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/usfsCWR/uniqueTaxa.html)

This map looks at the unique taxon between the prediction and observed datas and provides a full list. This will be the highest number of species of any map. 
All four layers are present and the an additional point layer datasets is added for botanical areas for ease of reference. 

### [Total taxon observed](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/usfsCWR/totalObservered.html)

This map highlights the number of unique taxon observed within each geography. 

### [Total taxon predicted](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/usfsCWR/totalPredicted.html)

This map highlights the number of unique taxon predicted within each geography. 

### [Total observation per cell](https://geospatialcentroid.github.io/usfsCWR/totalObsPerCell.html)

This map highlights showcase the density of sampling within a region. The values on the map represent the number of occurrences, which is different then previous maps that show the number of species. 
This is a more ganular way to look the distribution of collecting with in the region. Only the admin layer is present on the map as this layer encompasses the spatial extent of all other features.










## Material for 2024 CWR conference 

This work aims to develop a national inventory of crop wild relatives and wild utilized species on USFS lands based on previously published data.

This activity area will apply the occurrence information and species distribution models developed for approximately 600 taxa native crop wild relatives and wild utilized species, which were published in Khoury and Carver et al. (2020), to USFS lands, to develop inventories for USFS lands based on existing knowledge. 

### General Method 

PAD-US dataset was used as a spatial reference for all USFS lands. These were selected based on the `Mang_Name` == "USFS". All records sharing the same `Unit_Nm` were aggregated into a single spatial feature. This was done to reduce the overall processing time, as spatail relationships were test per each USFS area. 


### Evaluation of Occurrence Datasets

**Method Brief** : Occurrence data was transformed to match the CRS of the PAD-US dataset. For each unique USFS area, an intersect with the occurrence data was performed. The result provided all observations present within the designated area. Once define the unique number of species, total observations, and observations per area was calculate for each management area.

### Evaluation of Species Distribution Models 
**Method Brief** : Distributions models were transformed to match the CRS of the PAD-US dataset. For each species distribution, the USFS sites that intersected with the area of extent of the distribution model were selected. With this subset of locations, a count of the number of pixels within each protected area was generated. Once completed for all species, the total number of uniqu species, and the average area that each species was found within the protected area was recorded.
